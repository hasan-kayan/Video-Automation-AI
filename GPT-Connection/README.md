# Chat-GPT Connection API 

Here you can find a GPT connection API that is also can be used as a microservice, it has a very simple usage mechanism. You should send your prompt as a Json to the end point and recive the answer. I have write a basic docker file but here you should write yaml files according to your deployment service and needs. 

I have created command lines inside files first check the ./src/routes/routes.js you can understand it from there. 

I will provide more supports on this repo as much as possible, hope you get success.
